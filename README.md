# DesignDocument
A project from school in which we worked to recreate from scratch a file system.

Note: Only the Python files of the program are provided here. There are many accessory files needed to fully compile the program, yet these do not reflect on my coding prowess, and I also fear nefarious students using this repository to cheat if I do not limit access to some of the files.
